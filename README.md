# Assignment-2_Module-3-and-4
Hereby providing Python program  to  check the given number is odd or even and to print the integers from range 1 to 50 using for loop
**Check if a Number is Even or Odd
1.We have used the input function to get the input from the user and we have change the string input ( Input function will always return the string by default) into integer. 
2.We have used the If condition to check whether the number is divisible by 2 ( As Even number will be divisible by 2 whereas Odd number will not) by using % ( Modulo ) operator
3.Finally we print the nature of number by checking the above condition

**
Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
1. We have assigned a variable called sum as Zero
2. Using for loop we have make the program to sum the numbers based on the range function (range(1,51))
3. We have add each number sequentially and get this stored under sum.
4. Loop will stop once it reaches the range.
5. Finally we have used the print function to print the total using sum variable that we assigned to add the integers within the range.
